# Course: Applied Edge AI: Deep Learning Outside the Cloud (KI-Campus Platform)

## 0. Objective

This repository contains the notations and codes written during the study of the
course [Applied Edge AI](https://learn.ki-campus.org/courses/edgeai-hpi2022). It also contains the materials that were available during
the course.

## 1. Agenda

- [x] Week 1: Basics and History of Neural Networks
- [x] Week 2: CNN Architectures
- [x] Week 3: Compact Network Design and Knowledge Distillation
- [x] Week 4: Advanced Deep Compression Methods
- [x] Week 5: Edge AI - Introduction and Federated Learning
- [x] Week 6: Edge AI Concepts
- [x] Week 7: Final Exam

## 2. Laboratories

To practice, I converted some of the practical exercises, originally developed in Kaggle Notebooks, to small and minimally functional projects. Each project can be found on the folders named `labXX`.

- [Lab 2: CIFAR100](lab02/readme.md): Training an Image Classification Network on CIFAR-100 using PyTorch.
