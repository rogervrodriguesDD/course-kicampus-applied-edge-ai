    "Which of the following statements about Edge AI is true?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Edge AI can transfer data from the cloud-side data center to the edge-side storage space.\n",
    "- [ ] Edge AI will completely replace the cloud-centric AI paradigm in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following describes the motivation of Edge AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Most of the data is generated from data center.\n",
    "- [x] Reduce the bandwidth of data transmission\n",
    "- [x] Ensure offline autonomy of applications\n",
    "- [x] It can better protect data privacy.\n",
    "- [x] Improve the real-time capability and interactivity of applications \n",

    "\n",
    "Which of the following are **not** suitable applications of Edge AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Cloud gaming \n",
    "- [ ] Satellite \n",

    "### 2.2 Training and Inference \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements about training and inference in the Edge AI context are true?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Training and inference on Edge devices can somehow solve the non-IID problem.\n",
    "- [ ] If we perform training on the cloud and inference on the Edge device, we have to transfer massive Edge data to update the cloud-side model.\n",
    "- [ ] Collaborative inference refers to the use of multiple cloud nodes for joint inference.\n",
    "- [ ] We can send the edge-side data to the cloud node and do collaborative training on the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the collaborative training scenario, the cloud node does not need to transmit data with the edge node because the cloud node already has enough data to train the model. The edge nodes need to share data because their data volume is too small. Is the above statement correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] No\n",
    "- [ ] Yes \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Federated Learning (1/3)\n",

    "\n",
    "- [x] Strengthened data protection regulations, e.g., EU’s GDPR\n",
    "- [x] Data silos problem\n",
    "- [x] Mobile and Edge devices create massive amounts of data every day.\n",
    "- [ ] The edge-side data have relatively high quality, and thus they should be applied to a distributed machine learning system.\n",

    "**Question 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements are true?\n",

    "- [ ] Participants in federated studies are the federal states of each country.\n",
    "- [ ] Because it forbid transferring patients’ data to others, federated learning cannot be applied to the medical and health field.\n",
    "- [ ] The origin of federated learning is a technical project organized and supported by the federal government. \n",

    "**Question 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following are characteristics about Federated learning?\n",

    "- [ ] Unfortunately, the training data information can be reversely leaked through the model activations.\n",
    "- [ ] As long as the user data does not leave the local device, the training data information cannot be leaked. \n",
