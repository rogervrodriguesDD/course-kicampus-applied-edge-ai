Axis Order\n\nNote, that when working with deep learning frameworks, datasets, and image libraries the meaning of the array axes is quite important.\nThe libraries we use expect a certain order, since they need to \"know\" whether an array with a shape of 3x32x32 is one RGB image or three grayscale images.\nThus you often will recognize that a particular code, such as NCHW or NHWC is used to describe the expected order of axes.\nIn this code, the letters usually stand for the following:\n\n- N: *batch axes* (selecting one item along this axis would select one complete image)\n- C: *color/channel axes*\n- H: *height axes*\n- W: *width axes*\n- D: *depth axes* (usually only used when working with 3d images or tensors)\n\n### Reordering the Axes\n\nWe need to figure out which format the axes are in, when loading the data, since the data we are loading from CIFAR is not shaped and ordered correctly yet.\nOur data loader should return the data of a single image in HWC format, thus it makes sense to store the data in NHWC format first (we can simply select one image with the `[]` operator in python).\n\nTherefore, we should do some more data exploration to figure out how the data is stored in the given files.\nHere, it makes sense to examine the `shape` of the stored arrays and visualize some images, because we will need to do this to successfully load the images in our data loader.\nAlso remember that the CIRAR data consists of RGB images (3 color channels) with a size of 32x32 pixels.\n\nThere are two options: visualize a single image (easier), or visualize a set of images (harder).\nIn the following we provide a few hints for both approaches to this task:\n\n- Load the image data from either `train_data` or `test_data` (already done below)\n- Determine the correct shape of the array and reshape it accordingly\n- (A) Single Image:\n    - Tranpose the array of all images to NHWC with [transpose](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.transpose.html)\n    - Show one of the images with [plt.imshow](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html)\n- (B) Set of Images:\n    - Create a figure with [plt.subplots](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html)\n    - Add an empty list of ticks for x and y\n    - Create a torch tensor from a few images (e.g. 20) and use [make_grid](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/utils.html)\n    - Reorder the axes to the NHWC format with [permute](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.permute.html)\n    - Show the images with [plt.imshow](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html)\n    \n# Task 1: Getting to Know the CIFAR-100 Dataset\n\nIn the following you can start programming a few
